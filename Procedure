    Data Cleaning
    Feature Engineering
    One Hot Encoding
    Outlier Detection
    Dimensionality Reduction
    Grid Search CV

html/css/JS ----- Python Flask -----  Linear Regression Model
  (webiste)         (backend)


Cleaning is done .
Then applying k_folds or grid_search_cv ML model building
